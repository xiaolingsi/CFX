IPC-CFX is an industry-developed open international standard forming the foundation/backbone of Factory of the Future applications. IPC-CFX is a plug-and-play solution that simplifies and standardizes machine-to-machine communication while also facilitating machine-to-business and business-to-machine applications.

This project uses python to complete some scenarios in the CFX communication protocol. Complete scenario interaction can be achieved with the C# version of the SDK officially released by IPC.
The communication modes that have been implemented so far include Publish, RR (request/response).

The example/dev_test.py file implements the interaction of completed scenarios.
